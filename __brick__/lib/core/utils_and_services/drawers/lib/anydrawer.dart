/// AnyDrawer is a Flutter package that allows you to show drawers from any
/// horizontal side of the screen. You can also customize the drawers.
///
/// This package removes the limitation of the default scaffold drawer which
/// can only be shown from the scaffold.
/// Just call the `showDrawer` function to show the drawer.
/// You can also specify the `DrawerConfig` to customize the drawer.
